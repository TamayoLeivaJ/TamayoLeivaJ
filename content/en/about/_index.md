## About me

I am a PhD student in Genetics and Microbiology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. I am curious about microbial processes of genetic dispersal in their communities. I am a trained microbial ecologist and data scientist. I am a data enthusiast focused on analysis, modeling and visualization with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge and value from data. I am always eager to learn new topics, techniques and ways to expose information through dynamic tools.
