## About me

I am a PhD student in Genetics and Microbiology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. I am curious about microbial processes of genetic dispersal in their communities. I am a trained microbial ecologist and data scientist. I am a data enthusiast focused on analysis, modeling and visualization with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge and value from data. I am always eager to learn new topics, techniques and ways to expose information through dynamic tools.

## The reason for...

My undergraduate degree was in biotechnology, and my main focus was microbiology, so from then on I understood the importance of what is "out of sight". Therefore, if my interest was to understand these "out of sight" systems, it was necessary not only to generate reliable experimental designs for reliable data - the basis of any study - but also to work with large databases, because to understand real systems it is not enough to study a controlled environment, you have to go out and see the real world! So, I put on my explorer's suit and became an environmental microbiologist, which has been very entertaining and has allowed me to study diverse and wonderful environments such as the Patagonian Fjords and Antarctica. However, although all these experiences contributed to my scientific training that allowed me to face the first challenge, working with large databases and the necessary knowledge, such as programming languages and their logic, as well as statistical modeling, were a whole new challenge for me. So, it was then, towards the end of my degree, that I made the decision to learn something new throughout my PhD.

## The experience...

It was then throughout my doctorate that I began the process of learning to program from scratch, which although it was a great challenge because in college I never had programming courses, it allowed me to obtain tools to learn other things autonomously. Currently, I manage programming in **Bash**, **R**, and I am comfortable working with **git**. I have an advanced handling in visualization libraries such as {**ggplot2**}{**ggfx**}{**ggimage**}{**plotly**}, along with many other tools and libraries that allow me data wrangling, and manipulation with libraries such as {**tidyverse**} and {**janitor**}, and the statistical processing of data in R, which being a *lingua franca* for statistics has a wide collection of packages oriented to these analyses. Additionally, as my focus from the beginning was to generate complete analyses from data to graphics, I have learned to make reports with {**rmarkdown**} and applications with {**shiny**} which has allowed me to increase my options when communicating with the information. Finally, I have also used R to generate web pages -like the one you are visiting- with {**bloogdown**} and **HUGO**, along with interactive presentations on {**reveljs**} and {**xaringan**}, which are most useful when it comes to sharing or teaching about code, all the reasons why I also had to learn **HTML** and **CSS**.
