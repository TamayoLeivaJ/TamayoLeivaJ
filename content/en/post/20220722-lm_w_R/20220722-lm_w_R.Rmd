## Introduction {#intro}



- Response variable (also referred to as dependent variable)<br>
> The variable to be predicted.
- Explanatory variables (also referred to as independent variables)<br>
> Variables that explain how the response variable will behave.

Linear regression models always fit a straight line as close as possible to the data analyzed. These generated straight lines are defined by two properties according to the analyzed data: the intercept and the slope.



## R {#body1}

```{r}
lm <- lm(Price ~ ., data = Housing)
```
