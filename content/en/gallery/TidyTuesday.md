TidyTuesday is a project aimed at the R ecosystem where a new dataset is delivered weekly. The project emerged as a collaborative idea from the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, as an exercise to exercise the understanding of how to manipulate and organize data to make graphs with tidyverse tools such as ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr. However, it is not exclusive to the tidyverse, as the only rules are respect for the participants and sharing the code used to generate the results.
