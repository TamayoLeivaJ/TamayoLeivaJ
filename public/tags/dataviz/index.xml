      <description>Since I started learning R, my main motivation has been to get amazing visualizations like the ones made by CÃ©dric Scherer, Georgios Karamanis, and Thomas Lin Pedersen among many others. What mesmerizes me about them is that to achieve them you have to deal with code, data handling and proper graphical selection, but also understand about aesthetic design in order to achieve a great piece of visualization. However, while some are more trained and/or have been gifted with skills and taste for design and aesthetics - if there is something alike - for me it has been a journey in both aspects of data visualization, becoming enjoyable wingmen of the data science journey.</description>
