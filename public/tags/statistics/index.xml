      <description>I have often seen that people are interested in learning R because of the visualizations that can be generated with packages like {ggplot2}. However, R is a programming language, so its power is not only limited to that, but it is also a powerful tool for statistical analysis. Therefore, the main goal of this post is to provide tools to generate descriptive statistical analysis, and associated visualizations. This will allow us to better explore our data in search of patterns. Thus, here you will follow a step-by-step guide to perform descriptive statistical analysis and generate visualizations of your data to help you understand it better.</description>

      <description>Since I realized all the possibilities about coding in R -mostly- but also in other language, I wanted to create a blog to share some of the things I have learned. However, I also like the idea of a blog as a platform to share incoming knowledge as a learning-teaching process.</description>
